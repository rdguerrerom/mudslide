## Trajectory surface hopping using a cumulative approach rather than instantaneous
#
#  Instead of using a random number generator at every time step to test for a hop,
#  hops occur when the cumulative probability of a hop crosses a randomly determined
#  threshold. Swarmed results should be identical to the traditional variety, but
#  should be a bit easier to reproduce since far fewer random numbers are ever needed.
